## But Why

This project demonstrates a few features of [Jam Launch](https://jamlaunch.com)
including:
- WebRTC peer-to-peer
- Using Jam Launch OpenID to authenticate players with private APIs

It uses a stable diffusion pipeline via the Mystic AI APIs in order to generate
paintings in a gallery with your friends.

This project was made as part of [Backdrop Build v3](https://backdropbuild.com/)

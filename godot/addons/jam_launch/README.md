# Jam Launch Addon

This Godot 4 addon simplifies the deployment and hosting of multiplayer games.
It includes scripts for bootstrapping multiplayer games and an editor plugin
that facilitates deployment into the Jam Launch cloud.

Most feaures require a Jam Launch account. You can sign up for an account
[here](https://app.jamlaunch.com/?signUp=1).

## Example project

There is an example project that uses this addon
[here](https://github.com/jam-launch/jam-launch-example).

### Try out a deployed version

With a regular Jam Launch account, you can play a deployed version of
the example project [here](https://app.jamlaunch.com/g/FP8XMOFFKp/x17).

The current hosting servers are in eastern North America, and western Europe,
so you may encounter high latency in other regions. More hosting regions will
be coming online in early 2024.

## Deploy with a Jam Launch Developer account

With a Jam Launch developer account, you can deploy and test projects with one click from the addon's editor plugin:

## Test locally

If you don't have an account, you can still run games in local hosting mode with
the addon. This allows you to verify game functionality and compatibility with
Jam Launch.
